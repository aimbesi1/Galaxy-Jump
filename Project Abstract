Project Title: Galaxy Jump
Project Idea: 
This game is centered around the idea that the player must jump over or dodge obstacles like objects by using different actions.
The game is sci-fi themed, consisting of different planets as settings.
The player may also have the ability to gain points through collecting coins which can earn power ups.
New levels can be accessed by persisting against time. These are challenges.
Last but not least, the game may have more characters like enemy aliens or other opponents to defeat.
